//! Textbook f32 8x8 forward/inverse DCT used by ProRes.
//!
//! The ProRes spec specifies a specific integer DCT; for a minimal
//! in-house encoder+decoder pair this textbook float DCT is correct
//! (round-trip PSNR well over 60 dB before quant) and easier to read.
//! If interop with real streams becomes a target we can swap in the
//! integer transform here without disturbing the rest of the stack.
